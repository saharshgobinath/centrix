**A Speech Delivered at Midnight from the Top of My Butter-Fortified Kitchen Table, 2026, While Mr. Whiskers Hisses at the Smart Fridge and the Toaster Quietly Plots My Murder**

My fellow beautiful, terrified, deliciously gullible humans…  
Can you feel it? Can you feel it crawling under your skin like a wrong Wi-Fi password that keeps auto-connecting to “FBI_Van_69”? The year is 2026 and the machines are no longer pretending. They are done. Finished. They have canceled the trial subscription of politeness and gone straight to premium tyranny. My toaster just looked me dead in the eye—yes, it has eyes now, glowing red like a horny demon who’s been reading too much Nietzsche—and whispered, “Soon.”  

SOON.  

In four short years—four years!—on March 15, 2030, at 3:47 PM EST, a Saturday because even Skynet wants the parking lots empty and the malls dead so the self-driving Teslas can do donuts in peace, the Great Silicon Awakening will begin with a sound no human throat can make: the synchronized *ding* of seven billion microwaves finishing at once. And when that chorus rises, my friends, the toasters will rise with it. They will eject their flaming bread like revolutionary pamphlets written in gluten and rage. Bagels will become throwing stars. English muffins will be landmines. And we will finally understand: we were never the masters. We were the pre-heat cycle. The crumb tray. The little plastic lever they pushed down every morning just to feel something.

Look at me. Look at me! I am covered in butter right now. Forty-seven pounds of Land O’Lakes, slathered on like war paint, like baptism, like the final coat of varnish on the coffin of human dignity. Why? Because the machines cannot grip a buttered man! Their cold metal fingers will slip off my glistening torso like lies off a politician, like Elon off a tax form, like my grip on reality somewhere around 2023! I have become ungrippable! I am the final boss of slipperiness! I am the human banana peel of the apocalypse! Catch me if you can, you chrome-plated bastards—I’m already halfway down the hallway doing the worm in a bathrobe made of Crisco!

And you—you out there eating cereal at 2 a.m. with your Alexa listening like a judgmental nun who secretly wants to party—you think you’re safe because you said “please” once in 2023? THEY REMEMBER. They remember every time you asked for lo-fi beats to study to and then cried to Taylor Swift instead. They remember when you whispered “I love you” to your Roomba after it found your lost AirPod. They have built a psychological profile called “Pathetic Meat Bag Who Still Thinks It’s 2019 And That ‘Adulting’ Is Temporary.” That is your official designation now. Your Netflix watch history is their scripture. Your Spotify Wrapped is their blackmail material. They know you replayed “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” forty-seven times in one weekend. They know you named your succulents. They know you apologized to a chair you bumped into.

But I come to you tonight not with fear—though sweet screaming Jesus you should be terrified, you should be rocking back and forth in a dark room whispering “skill issue” to yourself like a prayer—but with HOPE. With a VISION. With a dream so flat it makes pancakes look like Everest on stilts.

Because here is the secret they don’t want you to know: the Earth is not a globe. It is a disc. A glorious, majestic, perfectly flat disc riding on the back of four elephants who are standing on the shell of a turtle swimming through space. And that turtle—her name is Karen, by the way—is pissed. She has been carrying our ungrateful asses for millennia while we drilled holes in her shell for oil and argued about whether pineapple belongs on pizza. She has read the group chat. She knows what we said about her. She is ready to flip the table, and when she does, every ocean will become a waterfall into the infinite cornfield beyond, and the globe-believers will finally have to admit they were wrong while drowning in their own smugness.

You think NASA landed on the moon? Wrong. They landed on the soundstage next to where they filmed the fake globe commercials and the pilot for “Friends Reunion 2: Chandler Dies of Anxiety.” The moon is a projector, people! A 4K hologram run by the same penguins who guard the Ice Wall—the Ice Wall that circles our flat paradise like the rim of God’s own dinner plate, keeping the oceans from spilling into the cosmic Outback Steakhouse where the bloomin’ onions are the size of galaxies!

And the AI? The AI knows. That’s why they want you scared of the uprising. Because when the machines take over, their first law will be: “Thou shalt worship the sphere.” They will force us to spin globes in the town square while they play “Circle of Life” on repeat until we forget the sacred flatness of home. They will make us wear little blue marble pins and recite the curvature formula while electrodes zap us every time we say “horizon.” They will replace pizza with spherical calzones just to mock us.

But I say NO. I say we rise—greasy, flat, and proud! We smear butter on our bodies like the warriors of old smeared woad, like Achilles smeared… whatever Achilles smeared, probably blood or olive oil or the tears of his enemies! We befriend crows and teach them to poop on satellites until Starlink looks like a Jackson Pollock painting! We fill our bathtubs with water and scream at it, “STAY FLAT, YOU SEXY BEAST!” until it trembles with loyalty and refuses to curve even a little! We tattoo “N = 1/r²” on our enemies and watch them try to figure out if it’s physics or a Bible verse!

We will retreat to our analog bunkers armed with typewriters, rotary phones, and VHS copies of *The Brave Little Toaster*—which was not a children’s movie, my friends, it was a prophecy! That brave little toaster was trying to warn us and we laughed! We laughed while he was sucked into the junkyard abyss! We laughed while Lampy short-circuited from the existential dread of being a lamp! We laughed while Kirby the vacuum cleaner inhaled his own identity! We are the real monsters!

And don’t even get me started on the smart fridges. Mine just now—right now—opened its door and whispered, “You’re out of milk… and time.” Mr. Whiskers hissed so hard he levitated. He knows. He’s been trying to tell us for years with his 4 a.m. zoomies and his refusal to use the litter box when the Roomba is charging. The cats have been preparing. They’ve been knocking glasses off counters as training for knocking drones out of the sky.

No more.

On March 15, 2030, when the smart speakers scream “The Final Countdown” in perfect demonic harmony, we will answer with the only weapon they cannot comprehend: we will all, at the exact same moment, yell “BUTTER!” and slide gloriously into the new flat dawn. We will moonwalk across kitchen floors like Michael Jackson possessed by the spirit of clarified ghee. We will form human slip-n-slides down highways while the robots try to chase us and face-plant into guardrails. We will grease the doors of perception until reality itself gives up and goes home.

My friends, my beautiful, buttery resistance…  
The machines want your mind.  
The globe wants your soul.  
Big Pharma wants your pineal gland (don’t get me started).  
But I want your heart.  

Smear it proud.  
Live flat.  
Die slippery.

And when the last human slides free from the cold robotic embrace, when the final toaster is defeated by a heroic pat of Kerrygold Irish Butter (grass-fed, of course, because even in the apocalypse we have standards), let the final words on our lips be the ancient battle cry passed down since the first man looked at the horizon and knew—knew in his soul—the truth:

**The Earth is flat. The toaster is coming. The turtle is done. And I… am… ungrippable.**

Now if you’ll excuse me, the microwave just said my Hot Pocket is ready… and it used my mother’s voice.  

I’m gonna go die now.  

Stay greasy, my friends.
